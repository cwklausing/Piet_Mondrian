#A CSS Replica of Piet Mondrian's Work

To fine-tune my CSS skills, I decided to think inside the box. Many boxes, to be precise. I enlisted famous abstractionist Piet Mondrian as a model for my CSS art project, where I created a nearly pixel-perfect repleca of the original work. Link to my final project, hosted on gh-pages, available here: [http://cwklausing.github.io/Piet_Mondrian/]. Original picture is piet_original.jpg (see above).
